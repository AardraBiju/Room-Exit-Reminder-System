### Project Description
Ever walked out of your room and forgotten your phone, wallet, or any other important item?  This project is about it.
 
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This project solves that problem by **reminding you before you leave!**
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The IR sensors play detective to see if you‚Äôre sneaking in or heading out, while the load cell keeps an eye on your stuff like a paranoid roommate. If you try to leave without your precious phone, the buzzer screams, ‚ÄòHey! Forget something?!‚Äô before you make your great escape.
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Embedded C
- Arduino IDE core framework
- `HX711.h` ‚Äì for interfacing with the load cell
-  Arduino IDE (code writing, compiling, and uploading)    
-   Serial Monitor (for debugging and output logs)

For Hardware:
-  Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
    
-   HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Module
    
-   Load Cell  
    
-   Two IR Obstacle Detection Sensors
    
-   Active Buzzer Module
    
-   Breadboard
    
-   Jumper wires
##
-  Arduino IDE for programming
    
-   USB cable for uploading code
    
-   Digital multimeter (optional, for debugging)
    
-   Small screwdriver (for mounting load cell)
    
-   Soldering kit (optional, for permanent setup)

### Implementation
For Software: 
1.  **Sensor Input Handling**
    
    -   IR sensors detect motion direction (entry or exit) using **falling edge detection**.
        
    -   Debounce logic ensures stable readings and avoids false triggers.
        
2.  **Weight Measurement**
    
    -   HX711 library reads load cell data at regular intervals (every 100 ms).
        
    -   Converts measured units to grams for easier threshold comparison.
        
3.  **Direction Logic**
    
    -   If **exit** is detected, system checks current load cell reading.
        
    -   If weight is below a defined threshold (e.g., missing phone), trigger alert.
        
4.  **Buzzer Alert**
    
    -   Buzzer turns ON for a set duration (5 seconds in code) when missing item is detected.
        
    -   Alert resets when person re-enters or weight is restored.
        
5.  **Non-Blocking Code**
    
    -   Uses `millis()` timers for weight updates and sensor reads to avoid delays.
        
6.  **Serial Debugging**
    
    -   Serial Monitor outputs real-time logs for testing and calibration.
# Installation
### **1. Install Arduino IDE**

Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website.

### **2. Install Required Library**

Open Arduino IDE ‚Üí Go to **Sketch ‚Üí Include Library ‚Üí Manage Libraries‚Ä¶**  
Search for **HX711** and install it.  
Or install via ZIP file:

`# Download HX711 library ZIP https://github.com/bogde/HX711/archive/refs/heads/master.zip # In Arduino IDE Sketch ‚Üí Include Library ‚Üí Add .ZIP Library‚Ä¶` 

### **3. Connect Hardware**

-   Connect IR sensors, load cell (via HX711), buzzer, and Arduino according to the circuit diagram.
    
-   Make sure wiring matches the pin numbers in the code.
    

### **4. Upload Code**

`# Open Arduino IDE  # Load the provided .ino file  # Select the correct board and COM port  # Upload the code` 

### **5. Calibrate the Load Cell**

-   Run the code with a known weight.
    
-   Adjust `calibration_factor` in the code until the reading matches the real weight.

# Run
Once the code is uploaded to the Arduino:

`1. Connect Arduino to your PC or a 5V power source. 
 2. Open Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE (9600 baud rate) to view logs.  
 3. Place your important item (e.g., phone) on the load cell platform.  
 4. Walk towards the door ‚Äî IR sensors will detect your movement. 
 5. If you exit and the item is missing, buzzer will alert you.` 

**Note:**

-   Adjust the `grams` threshold in the code if you‚Äôre using lighter or heavier items.
    
-   Make sure the sensors are positioned to clearly detect entry and exit direction.

-   **IR Sensors** detect the direction of movement ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre going **in** or **out** of the room.
    
-   A **Load Cell (HX711)** continuously measures the weight of items placed in a specific spot (e.g., your table or a shelf near the door).
    
-   If you leave the room (**exit detected**) and the system notices that the weight of your important item is missing (e.g., your phone isn‚Äôt there),  
    the **buzzer alerts you** before you‚Äôre too far away.
